# What I hope to learn in INFO 201

Since it is my first time taking an **informatics class,** I hope to learn the basics of R and organizing data.

I do have some beginning experience with *Python,* however I want to learn more about code.

### Some goals I have for this class include:
- Learn the basics of R
- Gain more technical skills managing and understanding data
- Learn how to apply these skills to my career and major (I am a public health major!)
